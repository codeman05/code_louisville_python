## Intranet

This site is the beginning of an intranet site my company will use.  It will allow us to create orders, generate barcodes and track internal statistics.
For the purposes of the Code Louisville project, only the test request, employee, test type, customer and department areas work.  This site will continue
to be developed in the coming weeks.  

This site will, hopefully, demonstrate some of the knowledge I have learned using Django's Framework.

## Requirements
The website is hosted on PythonAnywhere to facilitate the grading of the project.  It can be accessed [here](http://kenneth.pythonanywhere.com).  The username is 'kenneth' and the password is 'htennek'.
All code with the exception of a secret_settings file which holds some confidential information is hosted on this GitHub account.  FYI: If you try to clone this repo and run it on your computer, the project will not run without this file.
